h1. JIRA2Harvest

An extension for starting Harvest timers straight from your JIRA tickets.

h2. Instructions

# Download and install "extension":https://github.com/simonhildebrandt/JIRA2Harvest/raw/master/JIRA2Harvest.crx
# Set your username and password in the extension options
# Open a JIRA
# Watch the Harvest buttons appear and initialise
# Start/stop a timer mapped to this JIRA.

Timers are created based on the 'Fix Version' of the ticket, so it's assumed that you always have Harvest projects with identical names to JIRA fix versions.

_Developed at "Red Ant":http://redant.com.au, where Harvest and JIRA make our lives better. :)_
